# Windows 7
This is a little web os i worked on with @art0007i
I dont plan on continuing to use the win7.css library as it doesnt have a taskbar, and i dont really know how to implement one into the library even though i would.
I'm gonna say that the window system code is fine for my standards, and if i continue this project im probably gonna make a custom ui for it.

# The future
maybe im gonna attempt to recreate ubuntu gnome, maybe something like a try ubuntu website would be fun.
